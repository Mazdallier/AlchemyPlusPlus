So you want to be an alchemist, eh? You want to mix potions, learn about infusions and tinctures, and unlock the secrets of medicinal plants? I hope you brought a mortar and pestle, because...oh, you did? Hmm...I suppose we can start immediately then.

Playing AlchemyPlusPlus
========================
For the moment, it's possible to brew a number of otherwise impossible-to-obtain potions, such as blindness and Resistance. You can also mix and enhance potions to create some rather interesting effects.

See the [original mod topic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1909298-162152forge-alchemy-get-drunk-in-the-lab/) on the MinecraftForums, or check out the [new forum thread](http://goo.gl/vryzC4) for ongoing updates and discussion.

Getting AlchemyPlusPlus
========================
You can download the latest reasonably stable build from the [AlchemyPlusPlus CurseForge page](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/62428-alchemyplusplus), or if you're feeling brave, from the [Jenkins build server](http://jenkins.jakimfett.com/job/AlchemyPlusPlus%20v1.3%20for%201.7.10/).

I got permission form @mokonaDesu to take over the mod.

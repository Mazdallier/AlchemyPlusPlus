You want to mix potions, learn about infusions and tinctures, and unlock the secrets of medicinal plants? I hope you brought a mortar and pestle, because...oh, you did? Hmm...I suppose we can start immediately then.\r\n\r\nPlaying AlchemyPlusPlus\r\n========================\r\nFor the moment, it's possible to brew a number of otherwise impossible-to-obtain potions, such as blindness and Resistance. You can also mix and enhance potions to create some rather interesting effects.\r\n\r\n@todo - Add mod information, with crafting recipes, etc here.\r\n\r\nSee the [original mod topic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1909298-162152forge-alchemy-get-drunk-in-the-lab/) on the MinecraftForums, or check out the [new forum thread](http://goo.gl/vryzC4) for ongoing updates and discussion.\r\n\r\nGetting AlchemyPlusPlus\r\n========================\r\n\r\nFor the latest builds, check the [Jenkins build server](http://goo.gl/C1sVjY).\r\n\r\nI got permission form @mokonaDesu to take over the mod.\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakimfett/AlchemyPlusPlus/master/alchemypluspluspermission.png)\r\n\r\nThis mod is licensed under the [DBaJ non-commercial open source license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakimfett/AlchemyPlusPlus/master/LICENSE.md)\r\n","google":"UA-51742343-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
